# Github automation

In this repository I'm using python to automate the github taks. As I often use github to host and manage versions of my projects, I found it useful to automate some tasks like add, commit push or even create and [delete](https://bricefotzo.medium.com/how-to-delete-many-git-repositories-at-once-fe4e9ed61751) repositories. 

## Requirements to use this template:
-----------
 - Git ([Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if it's not already done)
 - Python 3 ([Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if it's not already done)
 - Cookiecutter Python Package >= 1.4.0 ([Install Cookiecutter](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) if it's not already done)  

# Automate add, commit and push 
> We'll use the file [add-commit-push.py](https://github.com/BriceFotzo/github_automation/blob/master/add-commit-push.py). <br>

As those 3 commands can be used frequently (daily,hourly or after finishing some tasks), I made a little trick to reduce them to one line. 
I just have to run the following command:
``` bash
$ py add-commit-push.py --commit 'Type your commit message'
```
# Automate the deletion of github repositories 
> We'll use the file [delete_repos.py](https://github.com/BriceFotzo/github_automation/blob/master/delete_repos.py). <br>

I often want to delete repositories(often many at once), so I wrapped the process in the delete_repos.py. Find more details in this [medium article](https://bricefotzo.medium.com/how-to-delete-many-git-repositories-at-once-fe4e9ed61751).
To delete repositories, you just have to run this:
``` bash
$ py delete_repos.py
```
# Automate the creation of github repositories
> We'lle use the file [create_repo.py](https://github.com/BriceFotzo/github_automation/blob/master/create_repo.py) and some functions in [utils.py](https://github.com/BriceFotzo/github_automation/blob/master/utils.py).
<br>

When starting a new project, it's important to have a clean and user friendly structure to share it with colleagues. As I work in data science, I use the [cookiecutter data science structure](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/). It's _a logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work._ accoding to the contributors.

### Setting up your github projects environment

**Step 1** - Create a workspace for your projects
``` bash
$ mkdir my-data-science-projects
```
**Step 2** - Clone this repository and set the environment
``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/BriceFotzo/github_automation
```
**Step 3** - Navigate to the repository and create a .env file to set environment variables
``` bash
$ cd github_automation
$ touch .env
```
**Step 4** - In the .env file, set those variables:

>GITHUB_USER = '{username}' <br>
>GITHUB_API = "https://api.github.com"<br>
>GITHUB_TOKEN='ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'<br>
>GITHUB_URL='https://github.com/{username}'

# Starting a new project 

Every time you'll start a new project, follow those steps:

Navigate first to your **data science projects** folder.
``` bash
$ cd my-data-science-projects
```

Then run the following command to setup a new project with (project name, project repository name, your name, a license and a python version)
``` bash
$ py create_repo.py
```
Once you're first repository is pushed, you can start developping.
Don't forget to add, commit and push changes every day or every important change (mainly when your code works!)

### The resulting directory structure
------------

The directory structure of your new project looks like this: 

```
├── LICENSE
├── Makefile           <- Makefile with commands like `make data` or `make train`
├── README.md          <- The top-level README for developers using this project.

│   ├── external       <- Data from third party sources.
│   ├── interim        <- Intermediate data that has been transformed.
│   ├── processed      <- The final, canonical data sets for modeling.
│   └── raw            <- The original, immutable data dump.
